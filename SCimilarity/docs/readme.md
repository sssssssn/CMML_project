# SCimilarity Project Documentation

## Project Structure





## Usage Instructions

1. **Ensure Project Structure**: Make sure the project directory structure is complete and all related files and data are prepared.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python dependencies for the project, such as `scanpy` and `scimilarity`.
3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Navigate to the `notebooks` directory.
   - Open and run the `panc8_scina.ipynb` file. Execute the cells in order to complete data loading, preprocessing, cell annotation, quality assessment, and result output.
4. **Check Outputs**:
   - Navigate to the `output` directory.
   - Check the output files, such as `panc8_scina_mod.h5ad` and `result_panc8_scina.csv`, to obtain the analysis results and evaluation metrics.
  

## Notes

- **Path Configuration**: Before running the code, ensure that the paths to the data file `panc8.h5ad` and model files are correct. Modify the path configurations in the code if necessary.
- **Extending Functionality**: If further analysis of the data or extension of functionality is required, additional code cells can be added to the `panc8.ipynb` file for implementation.


## Machine Requirements
1. **RAM**: For Windows and Linux users, 32GB and more are required. For Mac users, 16GB is enough.
2. **ROM**: At least 100GB of free space required.
3. **Operating System**: Unix-like systems are preferred, since some features are hard encoded.
